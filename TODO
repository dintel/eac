* Test initial window sizes from 2^10 to 2^32
* Test with both B = nw and B = nw*2
* Add uncompressed video test files
* Add more test case files with random
* Add timing tests for different nw,B and window size parameters
* Add graph generation for timing tests results
* Test with block significantly larger then nw (up to x16)
* Think about impoving algorithm by allowing coding of sequences on boundaries of blocks
